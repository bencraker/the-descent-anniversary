**The Descent â€“ 20th Anniversary Website Project**  
A very simple website celebrating the 20th anniversary of The Descent (2005), created as part of my Scrimba Frontend Developer course.  
  
**About**  
The task was to create a GifT website for a friend's birthday.  
Instead I decided to honour the anniversary of this movie instead.  
This is my first real attempt at creating a site with HTML, CSS and actually deploying it. 

**Built With**
- HTML
- CSS
