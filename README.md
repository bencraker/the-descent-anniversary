# The Descent – 20th Anniversary Website Project  

A simple website celebrating the 20th anniversary of *The Descent* (2005). 
  
**About**  
The task was originally to create a gift website for a friend’s birthday as Scrimba Frontend Developer course. Instead, I chose to honour the anniversary of this movie. This was my first real attempt at building a site using HTML and CSS, and deploying it online.
