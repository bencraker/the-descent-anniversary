# The Descent – 20th Anniversary Website Project  

A simple website celebrating the 20th anniversary of *The Descent* (2005), created as part of my Scrimba Frontend Developer course.  

**About**  
The task was originally to create a gift website for a friend’s birthday. Instead, I chose to honour the anniversary of this movie. This was my first real attempt at building a site using HTML and CSS, and deploying it online.  

**Built With**  
- HTML  
- CSS  

**Live Demo**
